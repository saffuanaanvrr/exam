Stocks Dataset","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/nifty50-stocks-dataset/versions/7","description":"### Context\n\nThe NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. It is one of the two main stock indices used in India, the other being the BSE SENSEX.\n\nNifty 50 is owned and managed by NSE Indices (previously known as India Index Services \u0026 Products Limited), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NSE Strategic Investment Corporation Limited. NSE Indices had a marketing and licensing agreement with Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s for co-branding equity indices until 2013. The Nifty 50 index was launched on 22 April 1996 and is one of the many stock indices of Nifty.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 index has shaped up to be the largest single financial product in India, with an ecosystem consisting of exchange-traded funds (onshore and offshore), exchange-traded options at NSE, and futures and options abroad at the SGX. NIFTY 50 is the world\u0027s most actively traded contract. WFE, IOM, and FIA surveys endorse NSE\u0027s leadership position.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 index covers 13 sectors (as of 30 April 2021) of the Indian economy and offers investment managers exposure to the Indian market in one portfolio. Between 2008 \u0026 2012, the NIFTY 50 index\u0027s share of NSE\u0027s market capitalization fell from 65% to 29% due to the rise of sectoral indices like NIFTY Bank, NIFTY IT, NIFTY Pharma, NIFTY SERV SECTOR, NIFTY Next 50, etc. The NIFTY 50 Index gives a weightage of 39.47% to financial services, 15.31% to Energy, 13.01% to IT, 12.38% to consumer goods, 6.11% to Automobiles, and 0% to the agricultural sector.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 index is a free-float market capitalization weighted index. The index was initially calculated on a full market capitalization methodology. On 26 June 2009, the computation was changed to a free-float methodology. The base period for the NIFTY 50 index is 3 November 1995, which marked the completion of one year of operations of the National Stock Exchange Equity Market Segment. The base value of the index has been set at 1000 and a base capital of \u20B9 2.06 trillion.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have records of all the NIFTY-50 stocks along with various parameters.\n\n### Important Note\n\n* % change is calculated with respect to adjusted price on ex-date for Dividend, Bonus, Rights \u0026 Face Value Split.\n* 52 weeks high \u0026 52-week low prices are adjusted for Bonus, Split \u0026 Rights Corporate actions.\n* 365 days % Change and 30 days % Change values are adjusted With respect to corporate actions.\n\n### Structure of the Dataset\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmP0ZQy.png)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis Dataset is created from: https://www1.nseindia.com/.
